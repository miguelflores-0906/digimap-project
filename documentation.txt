Quilt Documentation:

globally common vars
	res - the full img quilted with multiple patches of texture 


def quilt 

	texture = image to be processed 	
	patch length = user input var
	numPatches = dimension of overall image to be quilted, number of patches of the texture var (numPatches[0] x numPatches[1])
	overlap = var that helps determine where the next generated patch should start
	res = array holder for properties of the img to be built 

~converts img to float matrix
~initializes dimensions of img to be generated through quilting 
~takes an approach parameter to be used for the image to be generated 
~calls the randomPatch, randomBestPatch, and minCutPatch

def randomPatch

	i = y coordinate of the texture
	j = x coordinate of the texture

~generates random values that select part of the texture and returns it as a patch


def randomBestPatch
	
	errors = array with list of calculated errors for a specific boundary 

~half of the minimum error stitching equation
~calls L2OverlapDiff to calculate for the error of each side of the patch
~generates patches based on minimum error stitching with a cut path 

def L2OverlapDiff 

	error = calculated error for a specific coordinate in a patch

~other half of the minimum error stitching equation
~calculates errors for randomBestPatch

def minCutPath 

~vertical implementation of dijkstra's algorithm
